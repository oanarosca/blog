Hello! Welcome to my GCI blog!

My name is Oana Rosca, and I recently turned 17. I'm a high school student at the [National College "Dragos Voda"](http://www.cndv.ro/), 
a high school located in my hometown, Sighetu Marmatiei, a small city in northern Romania. I will be using this website as a blog during 
my participation in the Google Code-In 2016 contest, working with FOSSASIA on varied open source tasks.

I'm a Computer Science enthusiast, my main interests being data science, algorithms, web development, Python development, and also Android
development, although I'm not yet skilled enough to write a proper app.

For this edition of the Google Code-In contest, I chose to work with FOSSASIA because the tasks they offered were the most interesting to me,
and because this community welcomed me with warmth, through it being able to learn a lot about what open source means.

FOSSASIA is an organization established in 2009, whose main objective is supporting open source technology. FOSSASIA’s community is formed of developers who work on open source projects (web applications, mobile applications and many many more), but also of designers and contributors who wish to see a better future for people’s lives everywhere around the globe. Besides that, they are the host of many events, summits, and programming contests that bring together people from all continents so they can create, develop, and share their work with the open source community. Why not pay a visit to their [website](https://fossasia.org)?

Interested in contributing? See the projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/fossasia). Join the open source side!
